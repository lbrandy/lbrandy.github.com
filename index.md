My name is Louis Brandy. I am a software engineer at [facebook](http://facebook.com). I work on the Site Integrity team doing primarily SI-related infra work.

### A brief history

Once upon a time I worked at a startup in Pittsburgh that did face recognition and face tracking <http://pittpatt.com/>. They work for [google](http://google.com) now.

I attended the University of Florida where I graduated with three degrees. Two Bachelors of Science (one in Electrical Engineering and the other in Computer Engineering) and a Master of Science (from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering. Confusing. I know.). My focus in grad-school was on intelligent machines with a healthy dose of computer architecture.

Please donâ€™t take anything I say too seriously.
