On friday it was announced that the company I worked for for 5 years was acquired. I was employee #2 at said company. I left in January to join facebook. I won't reveal any financial details, of course, but suffice to say that I did own stock and so benefited from the sale of the company. With the sale of the company that I basically "grew up" in, it brings up quite a few interesting bits of closure, and other thoughts, perhaps that are worth sharing.

The company was started by two faculty members, one at CMU, one at UF. The first two (technical) hires were me and another guy from the UF's guy lab. It was a chance to work on "high" technology, get some good references, and maybe start a business. At some point early on, I tried to use those references to join a phd program before I realized I was more interested in startups than I was in phds (note: good choice). Soon after that, I began to buy into the general startup culture: hacker news, #startups, and so on.

The early startup employee is a neglected group, to be honest. There is very little information for you. Let's start with some of the most important.

Your stock isn't worth very much. The trust you have with the founders is worth orders of magnitude more.

You have no control. Even in the best case scenario, a deal will get done that won't involve you. Your stock might be sold for a 4-year earnout in Anchorage

.. is barely worth the paper is printed on. This section should really be called trust. Of all the things that really matter, nothing is as important as your relationship and your trust of the founders. The number of things you will sign, and the number of ways you can get screwed is frankly staggering. I got incredibly lucky in this regard, and it's only when the reality of the situations start to sink that you will realize

I cannot stress enough to you that if you want to be an early startup employee, and you want it to be more than a "job", you must absolutely positively trust the founders with everything. If you don't trust your founders, your stock is worth literally nothing. I cannot describe to you the number of ways in which you can get screwed as a naive employee, especially in an acquisition. I only began to realize this after seeing the ways deals went down, especially other deals. The founders of our company took our naive trust and did extremely well, in my opinion. The final

Let me tell you all the things I learned along the way, specfically speaking from the point of view of an early employee.

1. If you think you are going to get rich, you are fucking crazy. Let me make this very clear, since alot of this post is going to revolve around this: getting rich is the WRONG reason to join a startup as an early employee. We are one of the very rare companies that actually exits, and we weren't diluted at all (employee owned).

2. You absolutely, positively, have to trust the founders of the company with everything. Literally, everything. I cannot explain to you the innumerable ways in which you could get screwed, if they wanted to screw you. If everything goes well, and the company "exits", and you get a healthy chunk of change, that is entirely because the founder's wanted you to get that healthy chunk of change. It would have been so very easy for them to screw you, if they wanted. In this regards, I was -incredibly- lucky, for a whole bunch of reasons I'

3.

4. Don't begrudge anyone their success. Aside from the fact that it's a fucking shitty way to live your life, it's just doesn't make any sense. One of the most interesting aspects of the sale was the fact that I left just before it and therefore I "missed out" (note: I didn't really miss out, too badly). It seemed that people were "worried" that I was going flip out and go postal on them because of the relative numbers involved. Fuck that with a stick. We can argue about relative merits and bullshit notions of "deserving" and all that, but I'm never going to feel bad that someone who took this journey with me got rewarded.

That means I can finally talk about it! I was employee #2 and I left the company just a few months before the acquisition.
