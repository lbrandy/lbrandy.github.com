So according to <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/analysis_what_are_the_webs_top_sources_of_referral_traffic.php">this report</a>, Hacker News will drive more than 2x as much traffic to a site as reddit. Now, my site and most of its posts are right in the wheelhouse of both Hacker News and reddit (proggit, in particular). I've had several posts at or near the top of both sites, and have a pretty good feel for how much traffic each ones drives. Here's a spoiler: reddit wins, by quite a bit.
