This day is call'd the feast of Crispian.<br>
He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,<br>
Will stand a tip-toe when this day is nam'd,<br>
And rouse him at the name of Crispian.<br>
He that shall live this day, and see old age,<br>
Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,<br>
And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian.'<br>
Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars,<br>
And say 'These wounds I had on Crispian's day.'<br>
Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot,<br>
But he'll remember, with advantages,<br>
What feats he did that day. Then shall our names,<br>
Familiar in his mouth as household words-<br>
Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter,<br>
Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester-<br>
Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red.<br>
This story shall the good man teach his son;<br>
And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,<br>
From this day to the ending of the world,<br>
But we in it shall be remembered-<br>
We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;<br>
For he to-day that sheds his blood with me<br>
Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,<br>
This day shall gentle his condition;<br>
And gentlemen in England now-a-bed<br>
Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here,<br>
And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks<br>
That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.<br>
