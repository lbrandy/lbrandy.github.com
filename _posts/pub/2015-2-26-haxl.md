One of the things I've been working on the last few years, when they pry me away from my C++, is the Haxl project at facebook. Here's some links...

## Haxl's ICFP paper
[There is no Fork: an Abstraction for Efficient,
Concurrent, and Concise Data Access](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2628144)

## Security@Scale 2014 talk (by me)

Here is a talk I gave on this topic. This talk is very light on the Haskell/language details and heavier on the motivation and how it fits into practice at Facebook.
